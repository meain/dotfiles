;;; encourage.el --- Add a message to minibuffer every time you save a document -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Add a message to minibuffer every time you save a document
;; A simple package which is inspired by a neovim plugin at
;; r-cha/encourage.nvim which itself was inspired by a VSCode plugin
;; at nicollasricas/vscode-encourage which was inspired by Visual
;; Studio plugin Haacked.Encourage.
