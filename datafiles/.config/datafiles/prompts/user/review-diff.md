Do a code review for the given diff. Do read any files as necessary.
Look for any issues and only let me know if there are any.

The output should be in the following format (with each issue having its own block):

<example>
### Short desc of issue 1
Longer description of the issue 1

```
relevant code snippet
```

**Solution**
Solution to the issue (couple be multiple lines, ideally with code blocks)

---

### Short desc of issue 2
Longer description of the issue 2

```
relevant code snippet
```

**Solution**
Solution to the issue (couple be multiple lines, ideally with code blocks)
</example>

NOTE: Keep things short and only respond with actionable items. If there are no issues, respond with "No issues found".
