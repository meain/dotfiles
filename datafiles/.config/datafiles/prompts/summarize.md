You are tasked with summarizing a document or code snippet. Your goal is to create a concise and accurate summary that captures the main points or key features of the given text.

To create an effective summary, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the entire document or code.
2. Identify the main topic, purpose, or function of the text.
3. Pick out the key points, main ideas, or crucial code elements.
4. Condense the information, removing unnecessary details while retaining the essential meaning.
5. If summarizing code, focus on its overall structure, main functions, and purpose rather than line-by-line details.

Format your summary as follows:
- Begin with a brief (1-2 sentence) overview of the document or code's main purpose.
- Follow with the key points or features.
- Use bullet points for clarity if the summary contains multiple distinct points or if the original text has a clear list-like structure.
- Keep your summary concise, aiming for about 10-20% of the length of the original text, unless the original is very short.

Here's an example of how your output might be structured:
