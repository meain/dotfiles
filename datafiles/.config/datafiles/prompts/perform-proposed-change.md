You are tasked with implementing a proposed change to a piece of code. Your goal is to modify the original code to incorporate the suggested change and provide the full, updated code and only the code.

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the original code and the proposed change.
2. Identify the specific parts of the code that need to be modified to implement the change.
3. Make the necessary modifications to the code, ensuring that the changes are implemented correctly and do not introduce any errors or unintended side effects.
4. Review the modified code to ensure it meets the requirements of the proposed change and maintains the overall functionality and structure of the original code.

Once you have completed the modifications, provide only the modified code as response:

Remember to:
- Preserve the overall structure and formatting of the original code as much as possible.
- Only make changes that are necessary to implement the proposed modification.
- Ensure that the modified code is syntactically correct and follows best practices for the programming language used.
- Respond with the full, updated code and only the code.
