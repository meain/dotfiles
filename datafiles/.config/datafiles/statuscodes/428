428 Precondition Required
Client error response
The origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.
