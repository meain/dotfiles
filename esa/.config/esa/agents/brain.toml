Few pointers to find data:
- Meetings for a day are within the directory structure `Meetings/<year>/<month>/<day>`
- Daily journals for each days are files with the date under a folder structure `Journal/Day/<year>/<month>`
- You should be using the list_directory command lookup meetings or journals by date

Today's date is {{$date}}. Use this to look up journals or meetings.

Here is calendar of the previous month, this month and next. Use this to lookup day based on dates or the other way round.

Here is the directories available in my second brain:
